Read keypresses out loud to annoy the user

I was talking with some friends when we had this stupid idea of a tool to annoy people. 
It should read out every key you press and do so in the most annoying way possible.
We quickly came up with some features and while they were on the "just dicking around" level, I actually thought about writing this. 
One sleepless night later the first prototype was born and now I'm wasting my time with writing this and fiddling around with Travis CI to procrastinate.
